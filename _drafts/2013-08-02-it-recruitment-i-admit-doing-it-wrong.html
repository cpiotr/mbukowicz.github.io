1. Motivation skill is only a single factor. 2. Sense of abstraction, ability to simplify things, not only giving the solution, but also minimizing it. 3. Urge to learn and express yourself (very little number of people writing their own blog, maintaining stackoverflow/github account/portfolio, attending conferences, reading books to improve their craftsmanship), taking up another certificate exam does not count. 4. Being pro active (a little bit different than point 1). Looking to improve things. Good is not enough. 5. Depending on job position, different qualities are important. Sometimes more outgoing is great to establish good relations, sometimes good humour to cheer up the team through hard times, sometimes passion for technologies, etc. Skills differentation. 6. Do not underestimate little or no experience. Fast thinker, clever, witty, easy learner. 7. Do not expect certain solutions, certain answers. Look for thinking out of the box. If someone does not think like you, that does not mean he is worse. He can even be better, come up with better solutions, etc. 8. Do not stick to the test. Do not judge people by the answers in the test. Test is just an introduction to the interview. You can make your mind about a person after 5 minutes of free talk, but you should not judge a person based on a result of some test. I was once dumped on the HR test level.  <p>Some time ago I got the opportunity of being a technical recruiter. Going from one interview to another I learned how prejudiced and narrow-minded I was. Here are some stories that will hopefully give you food for thought.</p> <p>Lets start with the case that I'm feeling the most ashamed. There was this guy that really wanted the job. He was looking for work for some time and was very motivated to start as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I thought he hasn't done well on the interview, because he lacked the knowledge of certain frameworks that we were using in our projects, like Spring and EJB. However, as a developer he wasn't that bad. He solved the coding problem and was quite responsive when asked about more general programming stuff. Nevertheless, at first we have decided not to hire him. Unfortunately, we waited too long with the phone calls and the candidates we have picked had already found jobs in another companies. At this point lots of coding work started to pour in and we knew our team was too small to handle it, so we were desperate to expand our workforce and decided to give the guy a chance. He started right away and was assigned to do the maintenance of our main project. You can imagine how discouraging it can be to repair bugs in a codebase with history nearly a decade old. However, not for him, he was perfect for this job. His high motivation prevented him from losing focus. He wanted to solve the bug and move on to the next one. He was constantly asking for more tasks. I was ashamed how poor my judgement was.</p> <div class="my-info"><strong>Lesson 1</strong>: do not judge a programmer only by their technical knowledge. Other factors can also be very important to consider, e.g. how motivated the candidate is to get the job. </div> <p>The other time I got to interview a student with mere 3 months of working experience. Not only was the student not very experienced, the student was a girl. I looked down on her CV thinking she's not going to perform well. You can imagine how surprised I was when she showed up with confidence and self-esteem correctly answering technical questions. What amazed me more was how fast she solved the coding problem. She did faster than most of the more experienced male candidates. I could see she lacked some knowledge about frameworks and tools, but I knew she would catch up on this in a blink of an eye. The ending of the story is that I was not the only one to see her big potential. We tried to act quick, but did manage to employ her. Other company had already offered her a job position.</p> <div class="my-info"><strong>Lesson 2</strong>: do not judge a programmer by gender or working experience. Look for fast-thinkers and fast-learners. </div> <p>Another thing I learned was when examining test result of a candidate. For the recruiting process I created a test, where I put a standard exercise to sift the candidates - the FizzBuzz. Here is the definition:</p><pre class="brush:plain; gutter:false;"><br />Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. <br />But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number <br />and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which <br />are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". <br /></pre><p>The solution I would prefer for this problem is:</p><pre class="brush:java; gutter:false;"><br />for(int i=1; i<=100; i++) {<br />    boolean div3 = i % 3 == 0;<br />    boolean div5 = i % 5 == 0;<br />    PrintStream out = System.out;<br />    if(div3 && div5) {<br />        out.println("FizzBuzz");<br />    } else if(div3) {<br />        out.println("Fizz");<br />    } else if(div5) {<br />        out.println("Buzz");<br />    } else {<br />        out.println(i);<br />    }<br />}<br /></pre><p>I like here that everything is split up and this code reads nearly the same as the problem definition. However, some of the candidates gave a solution something like this:</p><pre class="brush:java; gutter:false;"><br />for(int i=1; i<=100; i++) {<br />    boolean div3 = i % 3 == 0;<br />    boolean div5 = i % 5 == 0;<br />    PrintStream out = System.out;<br />    if(div3) {<br />        out.print("Fizz");<br />    }<br />    if(div5) {<br />        out.print("Buzz");<br />    }<br />    if(!div3 && !div5) {<br />        out.print(i);<br />    }<br />    out.println();<br />}<br /></pre><p>The first second I saw it, I thought it's not the right solution. Totally, not what I was expecting. On the other hand it solves the problem. It took me a while to realize that I was fixed on the way a candidate accomplishes the task. Obviously, a candidate should have the freedom to choose how they come up with a solution as long as it solves the problem.</p><p>You may think this problem doesn't concern you. The truth is that whenever you are dogmatic about something, you fall for that. For example, lets imagine you were some agile fanatic. Now, suppose you encounter a person who says that she takes part in a successful project using waterfall-like methodology. What would you do? Ofcourse you would laugh in their face telling them to return to their cave. No logical arguments would convince you, even giving more details about the project or telling more about the client.</p> <div class="my-info"><strong>Lessong 3</strong>: do not expect certain answers. Look for thinking out of the box. </div> <div class="my-info">TLDR; 1) When hiring you should bear in mind that technical knowledge is not the only factor to consider (motivation, adaptability, responsibility are examples of other qualities). 2) Try to be as neutral as possible. Look for signs of prejudice in your thinking or behavior and try to rule them out. 3) Remember, you are searching for someone that fits for the job position, not someone that thinks like you. That means trying to find out how the candidate thinks, not only sticking to typical test questions. </div>
