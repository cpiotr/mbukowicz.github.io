<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is Mathew Bukowicz. I'm a polyglot programmer (Java/JavaScript/Ruby/PHP and more) from Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. As my day job I currently work in a Java shop, writing software for one of the largest telecom companies in Europe.</p>

<h2>What's this blog about?</h2>

<p>In this blog I try to share with you my experiences as a developer. My goal is to create posts that are entertaining and useful, so you, my dear reader, will hopefully have fun while learning new stuff.</p>
