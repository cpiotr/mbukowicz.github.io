<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is Mateusz Bukowicz. I'm a polyglot programmer (Java/JavaScript/Ruby/PHP
and more) from Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. As my day job I currently write Java code in one
of the largest banks in Europe.</p>

<h2>What's this blog about?</h2>

<p>In this blog I try to write down stuff I find useful in my day job. Human memory
often fails. You cannot have everything stored in your brain cache. My idea
was to store the most important points in one place (this blog) where I could
return any time and put back forgotten data into my brain's short-term memory.</p>
